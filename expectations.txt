Expectations for CMSC 100:

Web programming isn't exactly a strong suit of mine, so I was nervous to start this course. I know so much goes on into creating web applications, so I think I may struggle with the lessons and exercises. However, in the first few weeks of this course so far, the FICs seem to have proven to be effective instructors/teachers. I hope they stay consistent with the way they have been teaching and that they'll be able to really guide us, students, through CMSC 100.



Response:


I completely understand your nervousness about web programming, but I agree that the FICs have been effective in the first few weeks of the course. If you ever find yourself facing challenges in web programming, don't hesitate to reach out to me and I'll try to help you :D
